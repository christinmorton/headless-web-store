# Headless WordPress Online Store with Next.js

This project is aimed at creating a headless WordPress online store using Next.js or any other frontend framework to consume data from the WordPress REST API.

## Introduction

In this project, we leverage the flexibility of WordPress as a content management system (CMS) and combine it with the performance and interactivity of a modern frontend framework like Next.js. By decoupling the frontend from the backend, we achieve greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

## Features

- **Next.js Framework**: Use Next.js for server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side routing.
- **Online Store Functionality**: Implement essential online store features such as product listing, product details, shopping cart, and checkout.
- **WordPress REST API**: Utilize the WordPress REST API to fetch data such as posts, pages, custom post types, and custom fields.
- **Customization**: Easily customize the frontend UI/UX and store functionalities according to your specific requirements.
- **Scalability**: Build a scalable solution that can handle a large number of products and users efficiently.
- **SEO Friendly**: Ensure search engine optimization (SEO) by optimizing content delivery and metadata.
